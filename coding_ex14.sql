Practice Yourself Some Having
You are trying to find the phone manufacturers with the greatest revenue from selling phones.

Given a table of phones, print the names of manufacturers and total revenue (price * units_sold) for all phones.  Only print the manufacturers who have revenue greater than 2,000,000 for all the phones they sold.

Hints:

From the problem statement, it looks like you don't need to filter down any of the initial rows. That means you probably won't have to use the WHERE keyword!
