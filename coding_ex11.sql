Three Way Exercise
Hmmm...I wonder if any authors are writing their own reviews for books! You are working with a database of books, authors, and reviews

Write a query that will return the title of each book, along with the name of the author, and the rating of a review.  Only show rows where the author of the book is also the author of the review.

--SQL QUERY 

SELECT books.title, authors.name, reviews.rating
FROM books
INNER JOIN authors
ON books.author_id = authors.id
INNER JOIN reviews
ON books.id = reviews.book_id
WHERE books.author_id = reviews.reviewer_id;
