Inner Join Review
Join together the users and orders tables.  Print the first_name and last_name of each user, then whether or not they have paid for their order.

Hints:

Remember that to join two tables, we use something like JOIN orders ON orders.user_id = users.id

A user might have more than one order, so they might show up twice!  That is OK - we want to see each of their orders.

Reminder on the structure of the orders table:

+----+---------+------------+-------+
| id | user_id | product_id | paid  |
+----+---------+------------+-------+
| 1  | 1       | 3          | true  |
+----+---------+------------+-------+
| 2  | 3       | 3          | false |
+----+---------+------------+-------+
| 3  | 5       | 5          | true  |
+----+---------+------------+-------+
| 4  | 1       | 4          | true  |
+----+---------+------------+-------+
| 5  | 4       | 2          | false |
+----+---------+------------+-------+
| 6  | 2       | 1          | true  |
+----+---------+------------+-------+
